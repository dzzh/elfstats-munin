# elfstats-munin

A set of Munin plugins for visualizing aggregated data from web servers' access logs. These plugins are a part of `elfstats` project. They are intended to work with aggregated data prepared by [elfstatsd](https://github.com/dzzh/elfstatsd) daemon. Using elfstatsd and these plugins it is possible to monitor such metrics as number of calls per request, aggregated latencies (min, max, avg, percentiles) per request and response codes distribution. Development plans include adding more metrics.

Elfstats-munin plugins are written in Python programming language and are based on [PyMunin](http://aouyar.github.io/PyMunin/) framework. Python 2.6.x/2.7.x is required.
